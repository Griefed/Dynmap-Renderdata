# Dynmap-Renderdata
Dynmap renderdata for mods for use with my modpack [Survive Create Prosper 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/scp-survive-create-prosper)

This repository aims to provide renderdata for the Dynmap mod, which in turn makes Dynmap compatible with other mods or to be more precise:
**This renderdata helps Dynmap render mod blocks.**
